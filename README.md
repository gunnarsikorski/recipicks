# Recipicks

## Description

I love cooking at home. I love exploring new dishes and trying recipes that challenge me. During bootcamp that's been a bit stifled, naturally. So I'm very excited to integrate cooking new recipes into this SPA! Some days I know I want to cook but don't feel inspired by my cookbooks or I feel indecisive about what Im googling for. So with Recipicks, a user can simply click through a randomized repertoire of recipes until they land on one that excites! Once the user selects a recipe they'll have all the information they need to replicate it. Enjoy!
